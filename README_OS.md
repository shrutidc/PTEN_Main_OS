# Smart Pad Layout Optimizer (Implementation)

This is our hackathon implementation of the **Smart Pad Layout Optimizer**, a single-page web application that takes the challenge spec and turns it into a working demo.  

The app allows engineers to **upload drone site imagery**, place and arrange frac equipment interactively on a canvas, check for collisions/zones, and even run **AI-powered optimization** using Google‚Äôs Gemini API.

## üéØ Core Features
- **Upload Site Plan**
  - Supports JPEG/PNG images
  - Optional TIFF world file (.wld, .tfw, .jgw, .ftw) for auto-scaling
- **Equipment Library**
  - Frac pumps, blenders, sand equipment, datavan, wireline, manifolds, chemical skids
  - Drag-and-drop placement with correct dimensions
- **Collision Detection**
  - Automatic detection of overlaps and safety clearance violations
- **Zones**
  - Create exclusion zones (safety, buffer, restricted areas)
  - Delete zones or unlock equipment groups
- **AI Optimization**
  - Uses **Gemini API** to generate suggested equipment layouts based on uploaded site imagery
- **Export**
  - Export as **CSV** (with coordinates, sizes, rotations)
  - Export as **PDF** (with a visual layout + equipment index)

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / TailwindCSS**
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** for all logic
- **Canvas API** for rendering, zoom, rotation, and equipment placement
- **jsPDF + jsPDF-autotable** for PDF export
- **CSV export** via in-browser JavaScript
- **Google Gemini API** for AI-assisted layout optimization

## üìÇ Project Structure
Main_File/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # main application (open directly in browser)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ ... # supporting JS & style inlined
drone_scans/ # sample site imagery (plan / actual / planning)
equipment_specifications.json # equipment dimensions & metadata

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrutidc/PTEN_Main_OS.git
   cd PTEN_Main_OS/Main_File
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Enable AI Optimization
- Inside index.html, find the apiKey variable in the script section:
    const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
- Replace it with your Google Gemini API key.
- Now the AI Optimize Layout button will work.

  üìñ Usage

Upload a site plan (from /drone_scans or your own).

(Optional) Upload a world file to auto-set scale.

Choose equipment from the library and create groups.

Place equipment onto the canvas ‚Äî rotate, move, or lock groups.

Add safety exclusion zones if needed.

Use AI Optimize Layout to let Gemini suggest a layout.

Export as CSV or PDF for field use.
